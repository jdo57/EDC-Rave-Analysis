# EDC-Rave-Analysis
In collaboration with Nixon Zuniga, Kayla Sprayberry, and Nancy Duong.

Analysis through graphs using JavaScript, HTML, and the d3.js library to display the data we found based on the correlation between EDC Rave concerts with hospitalizations.

The following is a summary of our project from our report.

"For this project we decided to create visualizations, specifically graphs, for the Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas which is one of the largest EDM festivals in the world, of which it is expected that many attendees will consume illegal substances. Our graphs will explore how many overdoses have occurred in its 25 yearsâ€“from what substances, and if the number has decreased since EDCLV started providing education on drug abuse and administration of narcan.
We want our viewers to see the dramatic ratio of hospitalization to attendees, specifically the increase in this ratio from 2010-2020. This drove our interests to illustrate this data into graphs. We utilized both a scatter plot and a bar graph to show this information, where our scatter plot demonstrated our ratio of hospitalizations per attendee and our bar graph shows the increase of attendees at this festival and predicted some data for 2024 based on the previous year, and it is quite shocking to see the results behind the information we found online regarding this festival

We specifically searched up each year the festival was held. Ideally, we made a spreadsheet to keep track of all of our data where we got the year,  number of attendees and incidents, and the sources. Below is the link to the spread sheet. At the end of this report is where we found our information from and the spreadsheet we use to make it easier to access all this information.
When making this spreadsheet to display our data we needed three pieces of data that could make both of our graphs possible. This involved the years, and the number of attendees/incidents. We converted this spreadsheet into a CSV file to plot these points using the second tab of our spreadsheet. For the first graph we decided to use a bar graph where we used aqua colored bars to display how many attendees attended the festival. This time we use only the number of attendees and the years where we displayed the years on the x-axis and the number of attendees on the y-axis. We once again used a d3 extent and linear scale to display our information. This would have our scale evenly distributed between each year and number of attendees. We were able to draw the bars according to the range they needed to be in both year and number of attendees."

The CSV file titled "hospitalizations.csv" contains the data of the EDC Rave concerts and hospitalizations. Links where we gathered the data for the graphs from, which includes articles, statistics, and history of EDC Rave concerts will be uploaded soon.

This projects involves knowing the fundamentals of basic JavaScript and HTML, but also being familiar with SVG and the d3.js library, which you can learn more about through these links provided through the course known as CS/INFO 3300: Data-Driven Web Applications, taught by Professor Jeff Rzeszotarski, who severs within the Cornell CIS Bowers Department.
