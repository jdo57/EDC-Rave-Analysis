# EDC-Rave-Analysis
Analysis through graphs using JavaScript, HTML, and the d3.js library to display the data we found based on EDC Rave concerts and the correlation with hospitalizations.

This projects involves knowing the fundamentals of basic JavaScript and HTML, but also being familiar with the d3.js library and SVG which you can learn more about through these links provided through the course known as Data-Driven Web Applications (CS/INFO 3300) taught by Professor Jeff Rzeszotarski, who severs within the Cornell CIS Bowers Department.
